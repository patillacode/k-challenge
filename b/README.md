to populate and rebalance with 100 items just execute:
`python challenge_b.py`

if you want to have more or less items just execute:
`python challenge_b.py items_number`

Instead of using one database and tables within, I am using one database
for each number, it is easier and faster, and I am running out of time ^^!
